# mei-extData

This repository shows how the newly added <extData> tag in the 5.0 release of MEI (https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v5/content/index.html) can be used to encode performance data extracted from musical audio. 

<extData> allows for none MEI-formatted data to be linked to both a score element (such as a note) and a specific time point in an audio file (more details are available at https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v5/elements/extData.html).
